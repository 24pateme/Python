Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My partner and I have pretty muched finished our final project. We have created siulations of the hurricanes, added noise to the hurricane, and also added some data/stats about the hurricane aswell, which show up near the top right side of the screen. We also added a feature so you type the name of the hurricane you want simulated in and it runs the simulations of the hurricane and displays its statistics. If you enter "total" it displays combined data about all the hurricanes from the 2017 hurricane season and typing "done" kills the program. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We just need to rerun the code and fix small bugs and other small problems. Afterwards, we just need to make our small video showing off our final project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Orginally we wanted to do it so if you press "1" is simulates the first hurricane that occured in the 2017 hurricane season and pressing "2" would simulate the second one, and so on. We weren't able to figure out how to do that so we just made it so you type in the name of the hurricane you want to see the simulation of.
